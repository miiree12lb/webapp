The inclinometer will have to be recorded with video capture on \r\n            the mobile, and the values of the force sensor will be recorded with a camera placed inside the box. Before using the attraction, we will have to measure the distance of \r\n            the chair to the central point of the conical pendulum (value 'r' in the diagram). Therefore, when the Diavolo starts up, the two sensors will capture all the values of \r\n            the inclination (or angle) of the system, and all the values of the tension generated by the weight inside the box during a certain period of time.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Physical Concept</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n            In a system like that of the box and the chair, the mass of the chair and that of the box can be considered as proportional and therefore, if you take into account that \r\n            the inclination would be the same, since the box is attached to the chair, Thales could be applied, and the same would happen with the tensions, then we know that the \r\n            relationship between the masses and the tensions of the chair and the box is as follows:\r\n\r\n            <BlockMath math=\"\\frac{T_1 \\cdot \\cos\\theta}{m_1 \\cdot g} = \\frac{T_2 \\cdot \\cos\\theta}{m_2 \\cdot g} \\implies \\frac{T_1}{m_1} = \\frac{T_2}{m_2}\" />\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Equations</h2>\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li>Distance equation: <InlineMath math=\"d = L \\sin \\theta + r\" /></li>\r\n            <li>Force equations:\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li><InlineMath math=\"T \\cdot \\cos{\\theta} = m \\cdot g\" /></li>\r\n                    <li>< InlineMath math=\"T \\cdot \\sin{\\theta} = \\frac{mv^2}{d}\" /></li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>Velocity equtions: <InlineMath math=\"T \\sin \\theta = \\frac{mv^2}{d} \\rightarrow dT \\sin \\theta = mv^2 \\rightarrow v = \\sqrt{\\frac{(L \\sin \\theta + r)T \\sin \\theta}{m}}\" /></li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    const [isDiplomaPopupOpen, setIsDiplomaPopupOpen] = useState(false);\r\n\r\n    const openDiplomaPopup = () => {\r\n        setIsDiplomaPopupOpen(true);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const closeDiplomaPopup = () => {\r\n        setIsDiplomaPopupOpen(false);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const diplomaPopupTitle = \"OIFem 2021 Diploma\";\r\n\r\n    const diplomaPopupContent = <div>\r\n        <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}><img src={diploma} alt=\"diagram\" width=\"90%\"/></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n    return <>\r\n        <Popup isOpen={isFirstSummerJicOpen} onRequestClose={closeFirstSummerJic} title={firstSummerJicTitle} content={firstSummerJicContent} />\r\n        <Popup isOpen={isSecondSummerJicOpen} onRequestClose={closeSecondSummerJic} title={secondSummerJicTitle} content={secondSummerJicContent} />\r\n        <Popup isOpen={isThirdSummerJicOpen} onRequestClose={closeThirdSummerJic} title={thirdSummerJicTitle} content={thirdSummerJicContent} />\r\n        <Popup isOpen={isFisidaboPopupOpen} onRequestClose={closeFisidaboPopup} title={fisidaboPopupTitle} content={fisidaboPopupContent} />\r\n        <Popup isOpen={isDiplomaPopupOpen} onRequestClose={closeDiplomaPopup} title={diplomaPopupTitle} content={diplomaPopupContent} />\r\n\r\n        <h1>Achievements</h1>\r\n        <div id=\"jic\">\r\n\t\t\t<h2><a href=\"https://www.fundaciocatalunya-lapedrera.com/en/youth-and-science\">Youth and Science</a></h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Youth and Science program of the 'La Pedrera' Foundation is a gifted program aimed at talented young students in the 4th year \r\n                of compulsory secondary education (ESO) to promote their scientific careers. Every year many grade 10 (4th of ESO) students \r\n                apply their candidature to participate in the program and only 50 of them get selected. However, due to COVID 19,\r\n                students from 2004 couldn't enter the program in 2020. That's why in 2021 there were 30 people selected that were born in 2004 \r\n                and 30 that were born in 2005. The program is three years long. During three summers the candidates have the opportunity \r\n                to research. In addition to this, between the first and the second summer participants have to write a scientific article. \r\n                In the first year, all the participants go to MonNatura Pirineus in five different programs. The second summer is normally in a \r\n                national center and the third one in an international center.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <div className=\"overview\">\r\n                <div className=\"content\">\r\n                    <h3>Monnatura Pirineus</h3>\r\n                    <h4>Catalan Pyrenees</h4>\r\n                    <h4>First summer (2021)</h4>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        I was one of 12 candidates selected to participate in the program: 'Looking from the Sky: How Does Climate Change \r\n                        Affect Our Forests?'.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <button className=\"read_more\" onClick={openFirstSummerJic}>Read More</button>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n                <div className=\"content\">\r\n                    <h3><a href=\"http://essyi.hws.edu/\">ESSYI</a></h3>\r\n                    <h4>Second summer (2022)</h4>\r\n                    <h4>Geneva, NY</h4>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        I was 1 of the 46 selected studies into the 2 week summer course in environmental science through scientific, social, \r\n                        economic, philosophical, ethical, and political perspectives.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <button className=\"read_more\" onClick={openSecondSummerJic}>Read More</button>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n                <div className=\"content\">\r\n                    <h3><a href=\"https://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/prospective-students/lmh-summer-programmes\">LMH, Oxford</a></h3>\r\n                    <h4>Third summer (2023)</h4>\r\n                    <h4>Oxford, UK</h4>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        This course is designed to introduce students to the basic concepts of machine learning (ML) and artificial \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintelligence (AI) in a hands-on manner\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <button className=\"read_more\" onClick={openThirdSummerJic}>Read More</button>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div id=\"oifem\">\r\n            <h2><a href=\"https://oifem.es/\">OIFem</a></h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n                As mentioned in the <Link to=\"/\" id=\"link\">'About me'</Link> page, the last years of high school I participated in several Informatics olympiads.
